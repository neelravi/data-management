This repository contains a template for a Data Management Plan (DMP) for computational research. The DMP is a document that outlines how data will be managed during a research project and after it is completed. It is a living document that should be updated as the project progresses and as new data management needs arise.

This DMP follows the FAIR principles for data management: data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The DMP includes information about the data that will be generated during the project, how it will be organized, stored, and backed up, and how it will be shared with others.

## Organization of the data

This section describes how data will be organized during the project. Data will be organized into directories based on the type of data and the stage of the project. Each directory will contain a README file that describes the contents of the directory and how the data is organized.

### Data structure

Data will be organized into the following directories:

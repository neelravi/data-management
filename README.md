This repository contains a template for a Data Management Plan (DMP) for computational research. The DMP is a document that outlines how data will be managed during a research project and after it is completed. It is a living document that should be updated as the project progresses and as new data management needs arise.

This DMP follows the FAIR principles for data management: data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The DMP is organized into the following sections:

## Organization of the data

This section describes how data will be organized during the project. It includes information about the data structure, file formats, and naming conventions.

### Data structure

Data will be organized into the following directories:

Your cooperation is crucial in keeping our community's discussions constructive and organized.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mandatory completion of issue templates: We need all of the information   required in our issue templates because it ensures that every user and   maintainer, regardless of their experience, can understand the content and   severity of your bug report or change request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Closing incomplete issues:   We reserve the right to close issues lacking essential information, such as   but not limited to minimal reproductions or those not adhering to the   quality standards and requirements specified in our issue templates.

Opening multiple channels to ask the same question or report the   same issue across different forums hinders our ability to manage and address   community concerns effectively. This approach is vital for efficient time   management, as duplicated questions can consume the time of multiple team   members simultaneously. Ensuring that each issue or discussion is unique and   progresses with new information helps us to maintain focus and support our   community.</p> <p>We further reserve the right to immediately close discussions or issues that are reopened without providing new information or simply because users have not yet received a response to their issue/question, as the issue is marked as incomplete.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limitations of automated tools:  While we believe in the value and   efficiency that automated tools bring to identifying potential issues (such   as those identified by Lighthouse, Accessibility tools, and others), simply   submitting an issue generated by these tools does not constitute a complete   bug report. These tools sometimes produce verbose outputs and may include   false positives, which necessitate a critical evaluation. You are of course   welcome to attach generated reports to your issue. However, this does not   substitute the requirement for a minimal reproduction or a thorough discussion   of the findings. We reserve the right to mark these issues as incomplete and   close them.

First warning: Users displaying repeated inappropriate, offensive, or harmful behavior will receive a first warning. This warning serves as a formal notice that their behavior is not in alignment with our community standards and Code of Conduct. The first warning is permanent.</p> <p>1.2. Second warning and opportunity for resolution: If the behavior persists, a second warning will be issued. Upon receiving the second warning, the user will be given a 5-day period for reflection, during which they are encouraged to publicly explain or apologize for their actions. This period is designed to offer an opportunity for openly clearing out any misunderstanding.</p> <p>1.3. Blocking: Should there be no response or improvement in behavior following the second warning, we reserve the right to block the user from the community and repository. Blocking is considered a last resort, used only when absolutely necessary to protect the community's integrity and positive atmosphere.</p> <p>Blocking has been an exceptionally rare necessity in our overwhelmingly positive community, highlighting our preference for constructive dialogue and mutual respect.

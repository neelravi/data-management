# Roadmap of the Data Management project development

The roadmap outlines the future development of the Data Management project. It is a living document that will be updated as the project progresses and as new data management needs arise.


## TODO:

- [ ] Automatic generation of docx and pdf files from selection of funding agency and the archival repository.

- [ ] Promote the use of data provenance tools (like aiida)
